  <h1>Terms and Services</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 31, 2025</p>
  <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the App. This App is operated by a private group of independent developers. By using this App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>The App is a peer-to-peer connection platform. We provide a directory service that allows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Passengers to search for routes and view available rides.</li>
    <li>Drivers to list their contact and vehicle information.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App's sole function is to facilitate the initial contact between these two parties.</p>

  <h2>2. No Verification (Use at Your Own Risk)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not perform background checks, identity verification, or criminal record checks on any Passenger or Driver.</li>
    <li>We do not verify vehicle safety, insurance status, or the validity of driver’s licenses.</li>
    <li>The User assumes all responsibility for verifying the identity and safety of the person they are meeting.</li>
    <li>We strongly recommend meeting in well-lit, public areas and sharing your trip status with friends or family.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. No Employment or Agency</h2>
  <p>Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the Developers and any User. Drivers are independent individuals and are not employees, contractors, or agents of the App developers.</p>

  <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Drivers agree to provide honest information regarding their name, vehicle, and contact details.</li>
    <li><strong>Legality:</strong> Users must comply with all local traffic and transport laws.</li>
    <li><strong>Conduct:</strong> Users must treat each other with respect. We reserve the right to remove any user info from our database at our sole discretion for any reported misconduct.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Exclusion of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Developers shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or disputes arising from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any physical harm, accidents, or criminal activity occurring during a ride.</li>
    <li>Any financial disputes between Passengers and Drivers regarding fares or payments.</li>
    <li>Any technical failures or inaccuracies in the location data or contact info provided.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You agree that your use of the App is at your sole risk.</p>

  <h2>6. Payments</h2>
  <p>The App does not process payments. Any financial transaction or agreement regarding the cost of a ride is strictly between the Passenger and the Driver. We do not take a commission and are not responsible for payment disputes.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Service</h2>
  <p>We provide the App "as-is" and "as-available." We do not guarantee that the App will always be online or error-free. As a team of independent developers, we reserve the right to modify or shut down the service at any time without notice.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>Since we are not a registered company, any disputes related to these terms will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the developers reside.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
