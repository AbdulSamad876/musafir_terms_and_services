  <h1>Terms and Services</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 31, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>The App is a peer-to-peer connection platform. We provide a directory service that allows passengers to search for routes and view available rides, and drivers to list their contact and vehicle information. The App's sole function is to facilitate the initial contact between these two parties.</p>

  <h2>2. No Verification (Use at Your Own Risk)</h2>
  <p>We do not verify users, perform background checks, or validate vehicle/driver information. Users assume all responsibility for their safety. Always meet in public places and share your trip details.</p>

  <h2>3. No Employment or Agency</h2>
  <p>Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship. Drivers are independent and not employees of the App developers.</p>

  <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>Drivers must provide accurate information. Users must comply with laws and treat each other with respect. We may remove users at our discretion for misconduct.</p>

  <h2>5. Exclusion of Liability</h2>
  <p>Developers are not liable for damages, losses, or disputes from rides, payments, or technical failures. Use the App at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>6. Payments</h2>
  <p>The App does not process payments. Any financial agreement is between the Passenger and Driver.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Service</h2>
  <p>We provide the App "as-is" and may modify or shut it down without notice.</p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>Disputes are governed by the laws of the developers' jurisdiction.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms anytime. Continued use means acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
