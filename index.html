  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 31, 2025</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the App. This App is operated by a private group of independent developers. By using this App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>The App is a peer-to-peer connection platform. We provide a directory service that allows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Passengers to search for routes and view available rides.</li>
      <li>Drivers to list their contact and vehicle information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The App's sole function is to facilitate the initial contact between these two parties.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. No Verification (Use at Your Own Risk)</h2>
    <p>WE DO NOT VERIFY USERS. We do not perform background checks, identity verification, or criminal record checks on any Passenger or Driver. We do not verify vehicle safety, insurance status, or the validity of driver’s licenses. Users assume all responsibility for verifying the identity and safety of the person they are meeting. We strongly recommend meeting in well-lit, public areas and sharing your trip status with friends or family.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. No Employment or Agency</h2>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between the Developers and any User. Drivers are independent individuals and are not employees, contractors, or agents of the App developers.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Drivers agree to provide honest information regarding their name, vehicle, and contact details.</li>
      <li><strong>Legality:</strong> Users must comply with all local traffic and transport laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Conduct:</strong> Users must treat each other with respect. We reserve the right to remove any user info from our database at our sole discretion for any reported misconduct.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Exclusion of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Developers shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or disputes arising from:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any physical harm, accidents, or criminal activity occurring during a ride.</li>
      <li>Any financial disputes between Passengers and Drivers regarding fares or payments.</li>
      <li>Any technical failures or inaccuracies in the location data or contact info provided.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You agree that your use of the App is at your sole risk.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Payments</h2>
    <p>The App does not process payments. Any financial transaction or agreement regarding the cost of a ride is strictly between the Passenger and the Driver. We do not take a commission and are not responsible for payment disputes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Limitation of Service</h2>
    <p>We provide the App "as-is" and "as-available." We do not guarantee that the App will always be online or error-free. As a team of independent developers, we reserve the right to modify or shut down the service at any time without notice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>Since we are not a registered company, any disputes related to these terms will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the developers reside.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
